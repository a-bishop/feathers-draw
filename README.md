# Outdraw

> 

This project uses HTML5 Canvas and [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com), an open source web framework for building real-time applications.

The app allows multiple users to collaborate in real-time on the same drawing, which is persisted to a file-based db ([neDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb)) until the canvas is cleared.

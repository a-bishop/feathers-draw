# Outdraw

> 

This project uses HTML5 Canvas and [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com), an open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.

The app allows multiple users to collaborate on the same drawing. To view an example, visit the demo site on both your desktop and mobile phone and note how a drawing entered on one screen appears in real-time on the other.
